farmRun task starts farm web-apps inplace, in interactive mode.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle farmRun
----

== Effects
. Each farm web-app gets compiled (if it's not up-to-date).
. If farm configuration link:Multiple-web-apps-tutorial.html#_mixing_inplace_and_war_mode[overrides inplace property] for some web-apps to `false`, then each of these web-apps is assembled into WAR-file (if it’s not up-to-date).
. Embedded jetty starts in separate java process against compiled
classes and their dependencies (and, optionally, WAR-files) and listens for HTTP-requests on
link:Farm-configuration.html#_port[port] (default 8080).
. Gretty waits for the user keypress.
. When user presses any key (in the same terminal), jetty process shuts down.
. Gretty waits for jetty process to complete.
. Gradle script continues normal execution of tasks.

NOTE: by default this task does not depend on any "war" tasks. It's only when you override `inplace` property to `false` are some projects compiled to WAR-files and farmRun depends on respective "war" tasks.
