appRunWar starts web-app on WAR-file, in interactive mode.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle appRunWar
----

== Effects
.  The web-app gets compiled and assembled into WAR-file (if it's not up-to-date).
.  Embedded servlet-container starts in separate java process against WAR-file and listens for HTTP-requests 
on link:Gretty-configuration.html#_port[port] (default 8080).
.  Gretty waits for the user keypress.
.  When user presses any key (in the same terminal), servlet-container process shuts down.
5.  Gretty waits for servlet-container process to complete.
6.  Gradle script continues normal execution of tasks.

== Instantiation and extension

The object called appRunWar is actually an instance of link:Gretty-task-classes.html#_appstarttask[AppStartTask] class, created and configured for you by Gretty. You can instantiate or even extend this class on your own:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'org.akhikhl.gretty'

import org.akhikhl.gretty.AppStartTask

task('MyRun', type: AppStartTask) {
  // ...
}

class VerySpecialRun extends AppStartTask {
  // ...
}

task('MyRun2', type: VerySpecialRun) {
  // ...
}
----

If you are going to instantiate or extend this task class yourself, make sure you've learned it's properties and methods.
