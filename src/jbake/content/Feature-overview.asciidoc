Gretty is a feature-rich gradle plugin for running web-apps on embedded servlet containers. 
It supports Jetty versions 7, 8 and 9, Tomcat versions 7 and 8, multiple web-apps and many more. 
It wraps servlet container functions as convenient Gradle tasks and configuration DSL.

Gretty provides the following features:

== Gradle tasks

Gretty provides gradle tasks, which automate starting, stopping, testing and debugging web-apps. 
Tasks work out-of-the-box, without additional configuration, but are fully configurable/customizable.

See more information at link:Gretty-tasks.html[Gretty tasks] and link:Farm-tasks.html[Farm tasks].

== Spring-boot support

Since version 0.0.24 Gretty link:spring-boot-support.html[fully supports spring-boot web-apps]. 
You can run spring-boot web-apps and "normal" web-apps side-by-side on the same servlet container. 
You can control spring-boot web-apps with the same link:Gretty-configuration.html[Gretty configuration] 
and apply all Gretty features to them: integration tests, debugging, Jacoco code coverage etc.etc.

== Multiple web-apps support

Since version 0.0.18 Gretty supports link:Multiple-web-apps-introduction.html[multiple web-apps feature]: it can start arbitrary number of web-apps on the same servlet container. Gretty supports web-apps of various types: link:Farm-web-app-list.html#_project_web_app_references[gradle projects], link:Farm-web-app-list.html#_file_based_web_app_references[WAR-files in the file system] and even link:Farm-web-app-list.html#_repository_based_web_app_references[WAR-files from maven dependencies].

Multiple web-apps feature works out-of-the-box in link:Multiple-web-apps-configureless-setup.html[configureless mode], although it is fully link:index.html#_multiple_web_apps_configuration[configurable/customizable].

Multiple web-apps feature also works nicely with integration tests and with the debugger.

Since version 1.1.0 Gretty supports link:single-sign-on.html[single sign-on] on Jetty and Tomcat realms.

== Switch between servlet container versions

Gretty supports link:Switching-between-servlet-containers.html[easy switch] between Jetty 7, 8 and 9 and Tomcat 7 and 8.

== Product generation

Since version 1.1.0 Gretty is able to generate runnable products. It works as follows: you invoke "buildProduct" gradle task and Gretty accurately packs one or more web-apps with the specified servlet container (tomcat or jetty), configuration files and, when needed, with spring boot libraries. The generated products are autonomous and self-contained, so they can be deployed to vanilla machines without preinstalled servlet container. The only requirement to the target machine is the presence of JRE 6/7/8.

== Hot deployment

Gretty support feature of link:Hot-deployment.html[Hot deployment]:
When some assets have changed, Gretty automatically reloads your web-app. +
There is _cool extension to hot-deployment feature_ in Gretty since version 0.0.18: Gretty automatically recompiles and then reloads your web-app, as soon as source code files have changed.

You can specify that certain folders or files should be link:Fast-reload.html[fast-reloaded]: that is, when they change, they should not cause web-app restart. Instead, the changed files or folders are simply copied into running web-app.

== Web-app filtering

Since version 1.1.2-SNAPSHOT Gretty can link:Web-app-filtering.html[filter files in "src/main/webapp"] the same way as processResources can filter files in "src/main/resources". Gretty sources contain https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty/tree/master/examples/filterWebapp[example program] demonstrating web-app filtering at work.

== Web-app extra resource bases

Since version 1.1.2-SNAPSHOT Gretty supports link:Web-app-extra-resource-bases.html[web-app extra resource bases]. It means: additionally to "src/main/webapp" you can specify arbitrary directories that should be served as content of the given web-app. Gretty sources contain https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty/tree/master/examples/extraResourceBases[example program] demonstrating web-app extra resource bases at work.

== Web-app overlays

Gretty can generate link:Web-app-overlays.html[WAR overlays] automatically, each time you build your project.
Overlays are also fully supported when running inplace (without WAR) and when debugging.

== Virtual WEB-INF/lib entries

Since version 1.1.3 Gretty supports link:Web-app-virtual-webinflibs.html[virtual WEB-INF/lib entries]. That is: dependency JARs specified in "build.gradle"/dependencies are mapped "on-the-fly" to WEB-INF/lib directory. As a consequence, ServletContext.getResourcePaths("WEB-INF/lib") returns the expected list of JARs, even if you are starting a web-app "inplace", without assembling WAR-file.

== HTTPS support

Since version 0.0.23 Gretty link:HTTPS-support.html[supports HTTPS protocol] out-of-the-box. All you have to do is set property `httpsEnabled=true`. Gretty does all heavy-lifting for you: generates necessary cryptographic key, generates X.509 certificate, configures SSL-connector. Of course, you can fully customize HTTPS protocol via Gretty configuration properties or even via "jetty.xml".

== Debugger and integration tests support

Gretty provides link:Debugger-support.html[integration with Java IDE debuggers]. You can even debug multiple web-apps loaded into the same servlet container.

Gretty link:Integration-tests-support.html[supports integration tests]: it starts servlet container before integration tests and stop it after. Since version 0.0.22 Gretty link:Code-coverage-support.html[supports Jacoco code coverage] of web-app projects - both client-side and server-side. The resulting coverage information can be converted to report with the help of standard gradle task http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.testing.jacoco.tasks.JacocoReport.html[JacocoReport].

== Logging support

Gretty provides link:Logging.html[Logging] out-of-the-box, although it does not force it on your web-app.

== JEE features

Gretty supports link:JEE-annotations-support.html[JEE annotations] out-of-the-box, no effort needed. +
Gretty supports link:Web-fragments-support.html[Web fragments]: META-INF/web-fragment.xml and META-INF/resources in dependency libraries - both in inplace and WAR tasks.

== Jetty-specific features

Gretty automatically uses link:jetty.xml-support.html["jetty.xml"] and link:jetty-env.xml-support.html["jetty-env.xml"], if they are present. +
Gretty also supports link:Jetty-security-realms.html[Jetty security realms] out-of-the-box.

== Tomcat-specific features

Gretty automatically uses link:tomcat.xml-support.html["tomcat.xml"] and link:tomcat-context.xml-support.html["tomcat-context.xml"], if they are present. +
Gretty also supports link:Tomcat-security-realms.html[Tomcat security realms] out-of-the-box.
