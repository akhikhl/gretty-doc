When you apply gretty plugin, it adds +gretty+ extension to the
project. You can (but you don't have to) customize every aspect of gretty plugin
with the help of gretty DSL:

[source,groovy]
----
gretty {
  port = 8081
  contextPath = '/MyWebApp'
  // ... many more properties
}
----

All gretty tasks, when invoked on given project, use properties of gretty extension.

If you don't specify any properties in gretty extension (or omit it altogether),
gretty tasks run with reasonable defaults.

== Server-specific properties

Gretty extension supports the following server-specific properties:

[cols="1,1,1,10", options="header"]
|===
| Property
| Type
| Default
| Purpose

| [[_jvmargs]] jvmArgs
| List<String>
| []
| Additional JVM arguments to servlet-container process.

| [[_servletcontainer]] servletContainer
| String
| 'jetty9'
| Servlet container to be used in appXXX tasks. Possible values are 'jetty7', 'jetty8', 'jetty9', 'jetty93' (jdk 8 only), 'jetty94' (jdk 8 only), 'tomcat7', 'tomcat8'.

| [[_managedclassreload]] managedClassReload
| boolean
| false
| When true, Gretty gradle tasks facilitate your web-app with springloaded library, thus allowing to live-reload compiled classes and avoid restarting servlet container. +
See also: link:Hot-deployment.html[Hot deployment].

| [[_host]] host
| String
| "localhost"
| host is passed to servlet-container connectors. If you use HTTPS, host must match CN of the subject DN of the certificate (if you use link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_auto_configuration[HTTP auto-configuration], Gretty ensures this automatically).

| [[_httpenabled]] httpEnabled
| boolean
| true
| When httpEnabled is true, Gretty configures HTTP connector for the designated httpPort. Otherwise HTTP protocol is disabled. Normally either httpEnabled or httpsEnabled should be true.

| [[_httpport]] httpPort
| int
| 8080
| TCP-port used by servlet-container for incoming HTTP-requests.

| [[_port]] port
| int
| 8080
| This property is deprecated, please use httpPort instead

| [[_httpidletimeout]] httpIdleTimeout
| int
| null
| When not null, defines the time, in milliseconds, that the HTTP connection can be idle before it is closed.

| [[_httpsenabled]] httpsEnabled
| boolean
| false
| When httpsEnabled is true, Gretty configures HTTPS connector for the designated httpsPort. Otherwise HTTPS protocol is disabled. Normally either httpEnabled or httpsEnabled should be true. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html[HTTPS support].

| [[_httpsport]] httpsPort
| int
| 8443
| TCP-port used by servlet-container for incoming HTTPS-requests. +
**Attention:** setting httpsPort alone is not enough to enable HTTPS protocol. You must set httpsEnabled=true in order to enable HTTPS.

| [[_sslkeystorepath]] sslKeyStorePath

Note that interactiveMode only affects interactive tasks: appRun, appRunDebug, farmRun, farmRunDebug etc. Tasks having word "start" in their name are non-interactive and must be stopped by respective stop tasks. See more information on Gretty tasks link:Gretty-tasks.html[here].
